# Memory Game 

`Eventually` I decided to write a new simple game without any popuping ads and release it to the store. It took me several days to design / write / test and release. Now, about a year after, I open source it.

### Features

- 2 Themes : `Animals` :cat2: & `Monsters` :octopus:
- 6 types of difficulties :star2:
- Sounds on winning :musical_note:

If you have more ideas or you want to add more options / themes / sounds or whatever, fill free to update the source for yourself or open a pull request. :sparkles:
